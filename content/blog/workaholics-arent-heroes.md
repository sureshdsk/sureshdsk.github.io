I was reading this book called “REWORK”, I came across the chapter called “Workaholism”. I felt very much connected to the chapter since I spent my entire career believing in the similar idea. Looks like the author has given words to inner thoughts.

In fact, I never stayed late in the office just for the sake of daily working hours. I was very notable for leaving office at 6.30 p.m and I am notable for doing great work too. Not speaking of my last 6 months as I am trying and experimenting with my career and results are kind of disaster. LoL. If you know me personally.

I have seen people working late every day. Sometimes they even work on weekends. Some people think that it’s a badge of honour. Some people even appreciate them for their commitment to their work.


Working for extra hours doesn’t mean you get more work done.

The biggest problem with the workaholics is that they do not always look for smart ways to solve problems, they just love to more solve problems regardless of the amount of time spent.

Their workaholism creates a bad appearance on the other people who didn’t stay late at the office as lack of commitment and responsibility.

It even creates a bad culture making people stay at the office for extra hours for the sake of timesheet. These extra hours are usually spent on youtube, facebook and cafeteria.

It creates a confusion among the people that, they clearly don’t know what is worth extra effort and what is not.

Workaholics aren’t heroes. The real hero is already home because he/she found a faster way to get things done.
