When I started my **100 day writing challenge**, I was planning to write only technical tutorials. But I discovered a new version of myself when I wrote my first non-technical article on 1st January 2018. Language, especially English writing was a bit of a challenge for me. I have once faced, failed and barely won this challenge in my school days. It started in my 11th grade, when I changed my medium of education from Tamil to English.

So, when I started the 100 day writing challenge, I played it safe by committing to write only technical articles. But something happened, and I unconsciously broke out of my comfort zone. IтАЩve started writing non-technical articles. Now, I am way beyond of my goal for the 100 days writing challenge.

A lot of people ask me about how I come up with ideas for the blog articles. I currently have 3 strategies to create great content that is connected to myself personally but also hits peopleтАЩs mind.

## 1. Read Books
Reading books is one of the best things you can do to improve your knowledge as well as others. When you acquire more knowledge, you are more likely to share it with others. I took writing writing as a medium to share my knowledge and experience.

## 2. Look Around
When you look around yourself, there is a ton of great content present. All you need to do is observe carefully and try to look at the big picture. You can almost take any situation happening around you and write something about it. It is that easy. But there is a catch, people around you will start judging you and the possibility of misunderstanding is high. If you are the guy who doesnтАЩt care about what others think, you can nail this out.

## 3. Look Inside
By far this is the best strategy that has worked great for me. It is really easy to give words to something that you truly feel inside. You are your own treasure of great ideas. Sometimes you follow certain principles and philosophies very naturally, but donтАЩt even recognise them as a great ones. The key is to understand you and your thoughts. Meditation helps me a lot in this.
