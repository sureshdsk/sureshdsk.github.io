Creating a great piece of content is similar to cooking a tasty food. Let's see how they're similar to one another.

When you make your own recipe, it is equivalent to creating a new content idea.

You select the ingredients for the new recipe carefully, just like how you choose the messages you're trying to convey.

Using right quantity of ingredients and cooking is much same as writing the content.

You taste the food when cooking is almost done as similar as proofreading your article. You also check whether the food smells and tastes good as you check the tone of the content.

A great content is cooked well using right amount of ingredients. The content has its own smell and taste. You're a master chef of your own article. As a master chef, you need to create unique content of great taste and make the people visit your blog again and again.

Happy cooking!
