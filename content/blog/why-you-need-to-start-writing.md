It doesn't matter if you're a programmer, designer, marketer or salesperson, Your writing skill will help when you chat with someone, write an email or an article. Becoming a good writer is not just about writing, It involves the following aspects,

## Think clearly
When you write an email or a blog article, You need to think about the subject matter you are writing very clearly and decide what to convey.

## Communicate using simple words
It doesn't matter if you have a great vocabulary when your audience doesn't understand what you are writing. You don't need to use rich vocabulary unless you are doing poetry. Always use a simple language that is easy for everyone to understand. 

## Put yourself in someone else's shoes
Writing is not always about our perspectives, It is also about others. You need to consider putting yourself in someone else's shoes and think from their perspective. This ability comes in handy when you are building a product or understanding your customer's needs.

## Know what to omit
Writing is not just about the number of words and passages that you write, You need to know what to omit and focus on the important things. Ignoring unnecessary things will let you focus on what matters to your audience the most.


Having a better writing skill will always pay off. Start writing...!
