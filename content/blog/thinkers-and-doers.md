Thinkers are the ones who think and create new ideas and plans for bringing the ideas to reality. They analyse from different angles and layout the plans.

Problem arises when we stuck too long in thinking and planning as we get excited about the idea and we like to improve it to perfection. This is a never ending process.

Focussing more on thinking leads to inaction. We cannot make progress just by thinking. We need to act on it.

Doers typically execute the plan that consists of severals tasks. When we have a well defined plan and believe in it, All we need to do is focus on doing.

Is being a doer is easy? No. It takes a lot more discipline and commitment than thinkers do.

It is not possible to think and do at the same time. So thinking and planning in advance is very important but doing it bring us closer to the success.

Incremental progress is better than having a perfect plan. Donâ€™t over plan and Under act. Make it simple.

Balancing thinking and doing is a challenge for many. The secret to success is breaking down the complex overwhelming tasks into smaller tasks and take on them one by one and make improvements in the plan on the go.
