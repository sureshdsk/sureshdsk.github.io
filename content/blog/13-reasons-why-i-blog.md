{{< figure src="/img/13-reasons-why.png" alt="13 reasons why I am into blogging?" >}}

## 1. Help people through my blog
As a developer, I am solving a lot of technical problems everyday and I love to share it with other developers around the world. Contributing something back to the developer community gives me a moment of happiness and getting a "Thank you" comment or a message from a reader is one of the most satisfying moment for a blogger. I want these moments to happen  frequently, So I spare my time to craft useful tutorials.

## 2. Learn continously
Creating an unique piece of tutorial is not an easy job. Also, It takes a lot of effort to keep up on latest trends and technologies. I try to learn a lot of things just for the purpose of creating new interesting tutorials. It is not always about creating an unique content, Sometimes solving problems in an efficient way makes a great post.

## 3. Make money
You may think why "making money" is at number 3. By helping people and learning technology continously with blogging, Making money occured naturally as a biproduct. Using [IdiotInside.com](http://idiotinside.com) and It's [facebook page](https://www.facebook.com/idiotinside/), I was able to monetize using affiliate marketing and I've made a pretty good numbers. Eventhough I am not doing affiliate marketing nowadays, The money I've made earlier is more than enough to run my blog for decades. 

## 4. Inspire People
By writing articles regularly and sharing those with others, I am able to inspire some people to start their own blog. This moment is the most fulfilling moment for any blogger.

## 5. End to End execution
When you run a blog, you have the opportunity and liberty to do everything by yourself at your own pace. I take care of everything starting from purchasing a domain and setting up a web hosting server, maintaining servers, creating theme and plugins for the website and distributing content on social media.

## 6. Create Memes
I've found that sharing my blog content with supporting memes drives more traffic to the website. So I challenged myself and learnt to use image editing tools efficiently to create memes and featured images for my blog posts. Sometimes I just do it for fun.

## 7. Job opportunities
**Blogging is the new resume**. It may open doors to many great places. It is by far the best way to showcase my area of expertise, passion towards my work.

## 8. Reduce stress
When I've gone through a bad day, I scribble whatever I felt and what happened around me. Later, I look at it as a third person and see if there is any meaningful message that I can convey through that situation. If not, I move them to trash. This habit has a huge effect on my mental health.

## 9. Personal branding
Since I am a web developer by profession, having a technical blog increases my credibility and expertise in specific niche.

## 10. Being independant
Most of my gadgets I use are bought using my savings and blog earnings without having to ask my mom. This habit of getting things on my own boosts my self confidence. 

## 11. Creating multiple income sources
I like the idea of creating multiple income sources. One that pays you well and another that makes you happier. Having multiple income sources means you don't have to depend on one source of income. Creating steady income through blog is slighltly difficult when you do it part time. But once you get there, It becomes a brilliant life hack to boost your self confidence.

## 12. Experiment technologies
Most of the times, Before I try something new at work for example, choosing a new framework. I try it unofficially and develop something and experiment with it and then decide whether to proceed forward or not. By doing this, I am able to do my task fast at work without any glitches in production.

## 13. Share thoughts & ideas
When I start my blogging journey, I chose to write only technical articles. I was always afraid of writing non technical articles, So I took it as a challenge and started expanding my comfort zone.
