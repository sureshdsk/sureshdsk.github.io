Failure is an inevitable part of our lives. How we move on after the failure is the one that matters.

You study hard, write an examination and yet you failed in the exam. What will you do?

You proposed to a girl, but she rejected you. What will you do?

You attend an interview. HR said we will call you back but didn’t. What will you do?

You try to book a tatkal ticket using internet explorer and you got an error in the payment gateway. What will you do?

Suddenly your boss calls you to a meeting and says “You are part of the lay-off that is happening this year”. What will you do?

Hard questions. There is no right answer.

Do you think that it is somebody else’s mistake? Are you blaming somebody? Take a breath. Calm yourself. Look back and analyze the situation from your point of view and then from the other people who are involved in the situation. Try to understand what has happened. Did you identify anything that you can correct yourself? That’s an awesome job.

Let’s give it a try one more time!
