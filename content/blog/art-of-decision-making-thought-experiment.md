Decision making is one of the most difficult jobs we do everyday. When we have a bunch of options, we are not sure where our each options may lead and we do not want to make a wrong choice. How can we avoid this and make a better decision? If we can list down all possible events, its possible results, We will know the worst case scenarios and ready to face failure in a better way. In this article, we will see how we can use **Thought Experiment** to make a better decision. 

## Thought Experiment
The Thought experiment is a technique used to experiment and explore a theory, an idea or a hypothesis to figure out possible consequences without doing it practically. Great thinkers, scientists, and geniuses have employed the thought experiment technique to validate their brilliant ideas and hypothesis. Thought experiment technique is heavily used in reverse engineering.

Though this technique is usually used by scientists and engineers to experiment complex ideas that cannot be experimented in reality or due to the cost of the experiment. We can still use it in our day to day life to make decisions.

## Why Thought Experiment?
The Thought Experiment gives us the framework to explore ideas without practically doing it. 
It's well defined by its possible events and hypothetical questions are considered. This technique allows us to analyze, explain, predict & control events in a better and more productive way.

Thought Experiment is very useful in

* Strategic thinking.
* Decision making.
* Exploring ideas.

## How to do a thought experiment?

I have a startup idea and I want to become an entrepreneur. What can I do?  Can I quit my job today and build a startup? No, that decision may cost really high?? Let's use Thought Experiment to explore this idea.

We can have a list of questions like these,
``` 
"What if <Scenario 1> happens?"
“If <Scenario 1> happens, outcome is <Result 1>"
“If <Scenario 1> doesn't happens, outcome is either <Result 2> or <Result x>"
```

Let's jump into the experiment. I am having this series of questions to validate my idea. These questions may not be enough to predict everything, this is good enough to illustrate the idea of a thought experiment.

> What if I want to become an entrepreneur? <br>
> Do I have any product idea? <br>
> What is the idea? <br>
> What is the problem? <br>
> What is the solution? <br>
> Is there anyone who already solved it? <br>
> If Yes, Can I solve it better? <br>
> Do I have a business model that can generate revenue? <br>
> How much money I need, to get started? <br>
> Do I have enough funds? <br>
> If No, Is there anyone who can fund this idea? <br>

After answering all the above questions, I should have a better clarity on the idea. Having more clarity leads to a better decision.
