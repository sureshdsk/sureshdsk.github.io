Decision making is one of the most difficult job. When we have a bunch of options and we are not sure where our each options may lead and we are always worried about making wrong choices. How can we avoid this and make a better decision? If we can list down all possible events and its possible results, We will know the worst case scenarios and we can be perpared to face failure in a better way. In this article, we will see how we can use **Thought Experiment** to make better decision. 

## Thought Experiment
Thought experiment is a technique used to experiment and explore a theory, an idea or a hypothesis to figure out possible consequences without doing it practically. Great thinkers, scientists and geniuses have employed the thought experiment technique to validate their most brilliant ideas and hypothesis. Thought experiment technique is heavily used in reverse engineering.

Though this technique is usually used by scientists and engineers to experiment complex ideas that can not be experimented in reality or it costs a lot to experiment. We can still use it in our day to day life to make decisions.

## Why Thought Experiment?
Thought Experiment gives us the framework to explore ideas without practically doing it. 
Thought experiment is well defined and all possible events and hypothetical questions are considered. This technique allows us to analyse, explain, predict & control events in a better and more productive way.

Thought Experiment is very useful in

* Strategic thinking.
* Decision making.
* Exploring ideas.

## How to do a thought experiment?

Lets say that, I want to become an entrepreneur and make a difference in people's lives. Can I quit my job today and do a startup? No, That decision may cost really high. But we can use Thought Experiment to make a good decision.

We can have a list of questions like these,
``` 
"What if <Scenario 1> happens?"
“If <Scenario 1> happens, outcome is <Result 1>"
“If <Scenario 1> doesn't happens, outcome is either <Result 2> or <Result x>"
```

Lets jump into the experiment. I am having this series of questions to validate my idea. These questions may not be enough to predict everything, this is good enough to illustrate the idea of a thought experiment.

> What if I want to become an entrepreneur? <br>
> Do I have any product idea? <br>
> What is the idea? <br>
> What is the problem? <br>
> What is the solution? <br>
> Is there anyone who already solved it? <br>
> If Yes, Can I solve it better? <br>
> Do you have a business model that can generate revenue? <br>
> Do I have enough fund to get started? <br>
> If No, Is there anyone who can fund this idea? <br>

After answering to all the above questions, I should have a better clarity on the idea. Having more clarity leads to better decision.
